# Personal_Protfolio

I am a MERN Stack web developer with a strong interest in creating
responsive, visually appealing, and accessible websites. I work with
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and modern tools to deliver clean and efficient
code.

This is a Personal landing page project where I focused on clean UI, responsive design, and real-world layout structure. I replaced dummy content with realistic data and followed a professional project structure similar to production-ready websites.
